## üöÄ How to Run it Locally?

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed on your system.

### 2. Project Files
Create a folder for your project and add the following two files inside it:
* `app.py` (The Python code for the application)
* `requirements.txt`

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

part 4:
pip install -r requirements.txt

export GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  (For Mac)
set GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"(for WINDOWS)

## now run the application
python app.py
```
